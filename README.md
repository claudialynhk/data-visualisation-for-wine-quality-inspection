This project demonstrates skills related to Data Visualisation that can be very useful in processing Ocean Science Data.

The project itself are roughly divided into 3 parts:
1. To practise data importing and preprocessing skills by using the pandas library in Python. Correlation of different parameters can be visualised using tool e.g.heat map.
2.  To acquire a better understanding of supervised learning methods by using  scikit-learn. The database is trained with linear regression, logistic model etc
3.  To evaluate the performance of several supervised learning methods by conducting empiricial studies. Hyperameter tuning is also included to further understand ways to train models.
